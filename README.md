## Setup

- Each player should pick a side, either heads or tails. Then one of the players will take five pennies and flip them all together like a hand of dice.
- Each player takes the pennies that landed on the side they chose and add them to their side of the prize in a line.
- No conversions (explained later) allowed in the setup.
## Turn Sequence

Players alternate turns. On your turn, you must:

1. **Place Coins:**  
    - Add one coin to your side of the prize to the left of any coins you've already set down. You may place any coin that is equal to or less than the highest coin you have on your side. At the start of the game, your coin is the penny.
2. **Optional Conversion (once per turn):**  
    - After placing your coin, you **may** convert coins on your side into a higher denomination coin as you would expect:
        - **5 pennies** → **1 nickel**
        - **2 nickels** → **1 dime**
        - **1 nickel + 2 dimes** → **1 quarter**
        - **5 pennies + 2 dimes** → **1 quarter**
    - After converting, place the new denomination coin as your new outermost coin and return any converted coins to the bank.
- Throughout the game, your coins must be in ascending order from the prize outwards.
- Once each player has played a turn this completes the round
### End of Round Swap

After both players have taken a turn, check to see if one player has the same number of one denomination as the other player has of a different denomination. If that shared amount is **two or more**, they may swap that many coins. You will be shown a **Swap** button displaying a single coin from each side with an arrow between them. The computer decides automatically when it benefits.
The computer usually avoids setting up swaps where you could trade for a higher value coin and, when it has the chance, will swap for the better coin every time.
# Clarifications
- **A conversion** can only happen once per turn but it **does not cost you a turn**. You can either start or end your turn with a conversion, then play that converted value if you want.
- **The first player does not have the advantage**. If the first player gets to $1 in their turn, the second player can still play their turn for the round. If both end up with exactly $1 after the swap step, they tie and share the prize.
