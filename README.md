## Turn Sequence

Players alternate turns. On your turn, you must:

1. **Place Coins:**  
	- Add one coin to your side of the prize to the left of any coins you've already set down. You may place any coin that is equal to or less than the highest coin you have on your side. At the start of the game, your coin is the penny.
2. **Optional Conversion (once per turn):**  
    - After placing your coin, you **may** convert coins on your side into a higher denomination coin according to these rules:
	    - **5 pennies** → **1 nickel**
	    - **3 nickels** → **1 nickel + 1 dime** *(2 nickels = 1 dime only if you have a spare nickel)*
	    - **1 nickel + 2 dimes** → **1 quarter**
    - After converting, place the new denomination coin as your new outermost coin and return any converted coins to the bank.
- Throughout the game, your coins must be in ascending order from the prize outwards.
- Once each player has played a turn this completes the round
### End of Round Steal

Refer to this end of the round steal only once one of the players has at least 5¢ played. Otherwise skip this for now.

1. At the end of each round, coin flips determine if any player can steal from another player. Only use coins from the bank and return them once this is complete.
2. Always end a round with this steal flipping, **even the supposed winning round** to determine if the winner actually wins.

1. Like a handful of dice, take one coin of each (25/10/5/1) denomination and flip them simultaneously. Check the value of each in descending order start with the **quarter**:
    - **Heads:** Do one of the following, then proceed to the next round. **Ignore the result of lower denominations.**
        - If exactly one player has a quarter they must give that quarter to their opponent, who places it as their new outermost coin.
        - If both players have a quarter
	        - The player with the most of that coin gives one to the other player
	        - If both players have the same quantity, **both lose one of their quarters** back to their own supplies.
        - If neither player has a quarter, nothing happens.
    - **Tails:** proceed to look at the **dime** and follow the same rules as above for dimes.
    - If tails again, check the **nickel**, then finally a **penny**, following the same rules.
    - If tails is flipped for all four coins (quarter, dime, nickel, penny), nothing happens that round.
2. The winner of the steal can down convert the coin they earn to any denominations of equal value.

# Clarifications
- **A conversion** can only happen once per turn but it **does not cost you a turn**. You can either start or end your turn with a conversion, then play that converted value if you want.
- **The first player does not have the advantage**. If the first player gets to $1 in their turn, the second player can still play their turn for the round. If they score above $1, they win. If both end up with the same value, they should do the coin flip sequence again to see if any final steals happen. If after all that, both are still equal, they tie and share the prize.
- **Any coin is steal-able in the end of round steal**. It doesn't need to be the highest denomination for either player.
